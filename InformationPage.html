				<dt><h2>What is Communication</h2></dt>
				<dd>- When we think about how we communicate, the subject becomes a lot more complex. There are several categories of communication and more 
				  than one may occur at any time.Communication is a tool with which we exercise our influence on others, bring out changes in our and others’ 
				  attitudes, motivate the people around us and establish and maintain relationships with them. </dd>
				  
				<dt><h2>For what do we need the communication?</h2></dt>
				<dd>- Without a communication, you can't talk with any person or tell the other person/creature what you want/going to to.</dd>
				  
				<dt><h2>Who or what communicates?</h2></dt>
				<dd>- Every single creature in this world on maybe this galaxy or universe have to communicate. Some creatures don't even open their mouth
				  if they want to communicate and there are animals/creatures where you can't hear anything. For example bats, with their quiet sounds they
				  send sound waves to know where the nearest object is, this is for example useful in the darkness.</dd>
				  
				<dt><h2>Is communicating only possible with our mouth?</h2></dt>
				<dd>- No, of course not. Communicating is not opening your mouth and talking anything. Communicating means when you have a partner/friend or 
				  anybody that you send informations what he probably can figure out. You can send informations with your body language this the communication
				  without words or nonverbal communication. Communicating is also possible with music and We thought how nice would it be to have a radio to
				  learn sending informations or communicate through music.</dd>
